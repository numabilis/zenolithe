<h2>First Controlled page</h2>

<p>We refer as a <strong>controlled page</strong> a page that is served using a controller.</p>

<h3>Define a route</h3>
<p>First of all we need to tell what is the URL of that page. If we want to access this page using <code>http://localhost/myapp/sample2.php</code> for example we need to
declare a route to <code>sample2.php</code>.</p>
<p>Create a <code>routes</code> subfolder under <code>PHP-INF/lib/samples</code>. This folder will store all the routes definitions. A route is defined by a php file which
location inside the <code>routes</code> folder is the same as the URL part from the app folder (<code>myapp</code>) in the browser location bar. For example if you want to
define a route for the URL <code>http://localhost/myapp/path/to/the/file.php</code>, just create the file : <code>PHP-INF/lib/samples/routes/path/to/the/file.php</code>.</p>
<p>For our example <code>http://localhost/samples/sample2.php</code> we create a file <code>sample2.php</code> inside the <code>routes</code> folder :</p>
<pre>return array(
    'controller' => array(
        'class' => 'org\zenolithe\kernel\mvc\controllers\SimpleController',
        'parameters' => array(
            'viewName' => 'sample2-view'
        )
    )
);
</pre>
<p>This file declare a route (which is the file path under the <code>routes</code> folder) for which the request is handled by a controller which is an instance of the
<code>org\zenolithe\kernel\mvc\controllers\SimpleController</code> class which has the <code>viewName</code> property setted to <code>sample2-view</code>.
<code>SimpleController</code> is a controller defined by the zenolithe framework that render the response with the file defined by the <code>viewName</code> property.
Be carrefull that the name doesn't have the <code>.php</code> extension.</p>
<p>Later you will learn to create your own controllers to handle requests.</p>

<h3>Define a view</h3>
<p>As for the frist sample, we define a <code>sample2-view.php</code> file under the <code>views</code> folder:</p>
<pre>&lt;!doctype html>
&lt;html>
    &lt;head>
        &lt;title>Zenolithe sample 2&lt;/title>
    &lt;/head>
    &lt;body>
        First zenolithe controlled page !
    &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>
<p>In your browser go to to <code>http://localhost/myapp/sample2.php</code>.</p>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>It's time for you to create your <a href="{{site.baseurl}}en/quick-start/first-controller.html">first controller</a>.</p>
