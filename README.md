zenolithe MVC2 PHP Framework
============================

Zenolithe is a personnal project started in 2006 that aim to build a simple, lightweight but powerfull and highly modular framework.

I have in mind the following ideas when developping it :

* Simplicity of the design
* Separation of Concern
* Modularity
* MVC2 implementation
* Inversion of Control (IoC) / Dependancy Injection (DI) implementation
* No extra languages to learn (smarty for example)

What are the characteristics of such a framework ?

* Simple bootstrap mechanism
* Simple and extendable routing mechanism
* Simple and extendable locale resolver
* Simple and extendable dependency injection mechanism
* Simple MVC2 implementation
* Request interception mechanism

Read the [documentation](http://numabilis.github.io/zenolithe/) (work in progress).
